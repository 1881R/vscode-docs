# July 2022 (version 1.70)

<!-- DOWNLOAD_LINKS_PLACEHOLDER -->

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the July 1.70 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll find details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the July milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/main)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22July+2022%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people trying our new features as soon as they are ready, so check back here often and learn what's new.

## Workbench

### Easier title bar customization

For those using the custom title bar, the default on Windows, macOS, and the web, you may have noticed that we are introducing more interactive content to the title bar. While there are already settings to hide each of these elements individually, you can now right-click the title bar to access a context menu that toggles the menu bar (not shown on macOS desktop), [Command Center](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_69#_command-center), and layout controls.

![title bar context menu](images/1_70/title-bar-context-menu.png)

For Windows users expecting the system context menu, the menu can still be triggered by right-clicking the VS Code icon in the top left corner of the window or by pressing `Alt+Space`. Mouse position is used to determine the behavior when triggering with `Alt+Space`, so the custom menu will appear if it sits on top of the title bar.

![system context menu](images/1_70/system-context-menu.png)

For Linux users, due to [issue #156397](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/156397), the empty space in the title bar will not open a context menu. You must right-click one of the items in the title bar that you would like to hide.

### Improved menu bar folding

With the addition of the Command Center, we tried shrinking the menu bar to a hamburger menu to make space. After hearing user feedback, we switched back to the old menu bar folding behavior until most of the menu is collapsed and only then switch to the hamburger menu.

![responsive menu bar folding](images/1_70/menu-bar-folding.gif)

### Accessible macOS title bar zoom

Also as part of improving the Command Center experience, when interactive components are present in the title bar on macOS, the title bar will now zoom with the rest of the UI for increased accessibility.

![macOS title bar zooming](images/1_70/macos-title-bar-zooming.gif)

### Fold selection

The command **Create Manual Folding Ranges from Selection** (`kb(editor.createFoldingRangeFromSelection)`) creates a folding range from the currently selected lines and collapses it. The range is called a **manual** folding range and goes on top of the ranges computed by folding providers.

Manual folding ranges can be removed again with the command **Remove Manual Folding Ranges** (`kb(editor.removeManualFoldingRanges)`).

![manual folding ranges](images/1_70/manual-folding-range.gif)

### Preserve folded ranges

VS Code now keeps folded ranges, even if the folding range is no longer part of the ranges computed by a folding provider. A typical example is when the user comments out the file, starts a string literal, or creates a syntax error that makes it impossible to create all the ranges. Such folded ranges become 'recovered' ranges. They are removed once the folding provider comes back with ranges at the same location or by using the command **Remove Manual Folding Ranges**.

![restored folding ranges](images/1_70/restored-folding-ranges.gif)

### Hide folding controls

The folding controls in the gutter can now be hidden with the setting `"editor.showFoldingControls": "never"`. Folding ranges can still be expanded and collapsed using the folding commands and shortcuts.

### New command line option --merge

You can now use command line options to bring up the merge editor in VS Code:

```bash
-m --merge <path1> <path2> <base> <result> Perform a three-way merge by providing paths for two modified versions of a file, the common origin of both modified versions and the output file to save merge results.
```

This enables you to use VS Code as a merge tool for Git, for example, if you configure this in `.gitconfig`:

```properties
[merge]
  tool = code-insiders
[mergetool "code-insiders"]
  cmd = code-insiders --wait --merge $REMOTE $LOCAL $BASE $MERGED
```

### Search file decorations

Search results in the Search view now feature file decorations and colors to express the file's problems and source control information. This is similar to [how they are already shown in the File Explorer](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_26#_custom-view-file-resource-decorations).

![Search file decorations](images/1_70/search-decorations.png)

### Search multi-select

The Search view now also supports multi-select. Any actions (for example, dismiss or replace) that you perform on one result in the selection will also be performed on the other selected items.

![Search multi-select Demo](images/1_70/search-multiselect.gif)

### Tree find control

Tree views, such as the File Explorer, now support the Find control. You can press `kb(list.find)` inside trees to pop up the Find control. You can use the Find control to highlight matched elements or toggle the **Filter** button to hide all elements that do not match the search term.

![Tree Find control](images/1_70/tree-filter.gif)

### Arbitrary file creations via New File

The **File** > **New File...** (or **New File...** link on the getting started page) experience has been improved to allow for arbitrary file creation. You can now type a file name in the quick input box to create the file on disk.

![A input box with test.js inputted into it and the entry New File(test.js) selected](images/1_70/new-file.png)

## Editor

### Experimental: Code Actions Widget

We have been working to provide a better experience with **Code Actions** in VS Code. [Code Actions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_code-actions-quick-fixes-and-refactorings) include [Refactorings](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/typescript#_refactoring), Source Actions, and Quick Fixes.

The new experimental Code Actions Widget can be opened from the [Context Menu](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/ux-guidelines/context-menus) by hitting Recactor or Source Actions, from the Lighbulb Widget, or from Quick Fixes (Quick Fix Menu). Try it out via the `editor.contrib.experimental.codeActionWidget.enabled` setting. Let us any feedback you have on the widget by creatibng issues in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) or commenting in [issue #152913](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/152913).


![Code Action Widget demo, showing widget access from the context menu, the lightbulb widget, and quick fix.](images/1_70/code-action-all.gif)


In this milestone, we also added support for **Custom Keybindings** in the Code Action Widget, which includes the Quick Fix Menu (`Ctrl + .`). You can try it out by adding the following snippet with your desired custom keybindings to `keybindings.json`.

```json
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+k",
    "when": "CodeActionMenuVisible",
    "command": "focusPreviousCodeAction"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+j",
    "when": "CodeActionMenuVisible",
    "command": "focusNextCodeAction"
  }
]
```

## Terminal

### Shell integration enabled by default

Shell integration's automatic injection that [was moved out of preview last release](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_69#_shell-integration) is now enabled by default. For supported shell setups (most bash/zsh/pwsh configurations), it should all just work without any changes and you should see command decorations:

![When shell integration is enabled, blue, red and grey circles appear next to commands run in the terminal](images/1_70/terminal-si-intro.png)

_Theme: [Sapphire Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.theme-sapphire)_

If the feature doesn't light up automatically, you will need to set up [manual installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_manual-installation), which has been [simplified in this release](#more-shell-integration-configuration-options).

Automatic injection is enabled when the `terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled` setting is set to `true`, add this to your `settings.json` file to disable the feature:

```json
"terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled": "false"
```

This will disable only VS Code's shell integration injection. Even when disabled, if your setup has shell integration enabled for some other terminal VS Code understands, [it will pick those up](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_final-term-shell-integration). If you don't like the command and/or scroll bar decorations, [you can disable just their display](#more-shell-integration-configuration-options), while still taking advantage of the [extra functionality](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_features) shell integration brings.

### Simplified shell integration manual install

Previously manual install took several steps and was platform and shell specific. The new manual install uses our `code` CLI to fetch the shell integration script, which means it works cross-platform and when connected to a remote window, meaning you can sync it in your dotfiles and it should just work.

```sh
# Manual install on bash
[[ "$TERM_PROGRAM" == "vscode" ]] && . "$(code --locate-shell-integration-path bash)"
```

You can read more about how to install shell integration for other shells at [Terminal shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_manual-installation).

### More shell integration configuration options

The new setting `terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.decorationsEnabled` allows configuring command decorations to display in the `gutter`, the `overviewRuler`, or neither. This is available in the context menu for easy access, along with configuring the icons:

![The command decoration context menu contains the new option Configure Command Decorations](images/1_70/terminal-si-config.png)

### Default color and icon tab settings

The default icon and terminal tab color can be set now per folder using `terminal.integrated.tabs.defaultIcon` and `terminal.integrated.tabs.defaultColor`.

### Extended PowerShell keybindings

There are additional PowerShell keybindings, such as `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)`, thanks to shell integration. These weren't possible before due to the lack of VT encoding. Provided that shell integration is working in pwsh, the following keybindings should now work:

* `kbstyle(Ctrl+Space)` - Defaults to `MenuComplete` on Windows only.
* `kbstyle(Alt+Space)` - Defaults to `SetMark`.
* `kbstyle(Shift+Enter)` - Defaults to `AddLine`.
* `kbstyle(Shift+End)` - Defaults to `SelectLine`.
* `kbstyle(Shift+Home)` - Defaults to `SelectBackwardsLine`.

This applies to **all platforms**, even Linux/macOS where those keys are normally possible. The defaults can always be reset in your pwsh profile with `Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler`. If there are additional keybindings that you expect, [please let us know](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/new).

### Run recent command as a replacement for reverse search

When shell integration is enabled, we're aiming run recent command to be a cross-shell drop in replacement for the shell's reverse search (`kbstyle(Ctrl+R)`). There is a new contiguous search mode that is the default when triggering the command. This behaves like `kbstyle(Ctrl+R)` in most shells, with the option of switching back to fuzzy search:

![Run recent command's contiguous search will match the search term exactly, toggle Fuzzy Search to switch to fuzzy searching](images/1_70/terminal-si-run-recent-command.gif)

The new `inTerminalRunCommandPicker` context key is available that allows setting up a keybinding like `kbStyle(Ctrl+R)` to go to the next match. For example, the following keybindings are now a fairly complete replacement for your shell's reverse search, with `kbstyle(Ctrl+Alt+R)` as a fallback to the old behavior:

```json
{ "key": "ctrl+r",     "command": "workbench.action.terminal.runRecentCommand", "when": "terminalFocus" },
{ "key": "ctrl+alt+r", "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence", "args": { "text": "\u0012"/*^R*/ }, "when": "terminalFocus" },
{ "key": "ctrl+r",     "command": "workbench.action.quickOpenNavigateNextInViewPicker", "when": "inQuickOpen && inTerminalRunCommandPicker" },
```

Multi-line commands now display a new line symbol where appropriate and will also use bracketed paste mode, meaning they are treated as if they were pasted for supporting shells. This typically means they will all be added to the same prompt instead of executing them separately.

![Run recent command now shows the "Return Symbol" Unicode character (⏎, U+23CE) to visualize new lines](images/1_70/terminal-si-multi-line.png)

### Other shell integration improvements

Here are the smaller improvements to shell integration:

* Command navigation has improved visual feedback, showing the "focus border" briefly and then keeping a persistent rectangle in the gutter to help better orient the user after jumping around the buffer.

  ![A solid rectangle the color of your themes focus color now appears to the left of the command being navigated to](images/1_70/terminal-nav-feedback.png)

* The new `workbench.action.terminal.copyLastCommand` command is available to allow a keybinding to copy the last command's output (shortcut for `kbStyle(Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Up)`, `kbStyle(Ctrl/Cmd+C)`, `kbStyle(Escape)`, `kbStyle(Ctrl/Cmd+End)`).

* Bash shell integration
  * More `$PROMPT_COMMAND` formats are supported.
  * Shell integration should work even better when the [`bash-preexec`](https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec) helper is being used already.

### Rendering improvements

Several improvements were made to terminal rendering when GPU acceleration is enabled:

* Semi-circle Powerline symbols are now custom rendered. Like the arrow symbols in the previous release, these should blend seamlessly with adjacent cells and extend to the height of the cell even when line height is used.

  ![Semi-circle Powerline symbols now render without needing to configure a font](images/1_70/terminal-semi-circle.png)

* Round cornered box drawing characters (`╭`, `╮`, `╰`, `╯`) now use a smoother curve.

  ![These round corner symbols now use render as perfect 1/4 circles](images/1_70/terminal-curve-render.png)

* Improved clipping of glyphs when background color changes, this was commonly seen when `npm` output a warning.

  ![Wide characters like W used to sometimes escape the background of a cell, when the background of the text was yellow the W in "WARN" for example could show unexpected yellow pixels in the top left which no longer happens](images/1_70/terminal-render-clip.png)

* Similar to the clipping problem above, an issue where the anti-aliasing in some glyphs would overlap other characters could really degrade the visuals. This problem is most easily illustrated using a background example like above. A pixel in the `k` of `Work` could also escape the bounds of the cell in the other direction, this pixel will no longer appear in the glyph at all since it's removed for being essentially the same color as the background.

  ![A pixel in `k` could overlap with the cell to the right, in this case that pixel may not be rendered at all if the difference in color and the background is small](images/1_70/terminal-render-px.png)

## Tasks

### Filter support for run task command

The **Tasks: Run Task** action supports filtering by task name and type for a more concise and configurable way to select and execute tasks.

For example:

```json
args: {
  task: "VS Code - Build"
  type: "npm"
}
```

### Improved automatic tasks flow

The Trusted Workspace feature has allowed us to simplify the flow for running automatic tasks. By default, these will run if a folder is trusted and prompt once per folder otherwise. This can be configured via `task.allowAutomaticTasks`.

## Source Control

### Action button improvements

We continued to polish the Source Control action button based on user feedback:

* The **Sync Changes** action button is only shown when there is a high degree of certainty that the local branch is either ahead or behind the remote tracking branch.
* The **Commit** action button is only enabled based on the list of changed resources while factoring in the smart commit settings - `git.enableSmartCommit`, `git.suggestSmartCommit`, `git.smartCommitChanges`.
* The **Commit** action button icon is updated based on the branch protection settings - `git.branchProtection`, `git.branchProtectionPrompt`.

### Improved rebase conflict resolution

This milestone we addressed some paper cuts in the rebase flow when resolving merge conflicts. Users should now be able to continue the rebase operation using the **Commit** button in the Source Control view after resolving all merge conflicts.

### Commit input field spell checking

This milestone we validated that all the necessary extension APIs are available to support spell checking for the commit input field. We reached out to the authors of two popular spell checking extensions and submitted pull requests illustrating how to update their extensions to provide spell checking for the commit input field.

## Debugging

### JavaScript debugging

When you create a launch config to debug a JavaScript/TypeScript program, you can set `"console": "integratedTerminal"` to run that program in a terminal (rather than the process being spawned directly). A few months ago, we noticed that `"args"` in the launch config were partly escaped for the shell, but not entirely. This meant that attempting to pass an argument to your program could accidentally trigger special behavior in your shell. We cleaned this up, then realized that setting arguments that include characters with special meanings for the shell is a useful thing to do, and that some users were relying on this behavior. We debated the correct fix and decided that this behavior should be opt-in, and that changes to the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) (DAP) were required. We made [this change to DAP](#argsCanBeInterpretedByShell-for-RunInTerminalRequest), implemented it in VS Code and in js-debug, and other debug adapters should be soon to follow.

Here's how to use the new behavior in a node launch config.

```jsonc
{
    "type": "node",
    "console": "integratedTerminal",
    ...

    // If you pass args as a single string, the characters will not be escaped for the terminal, so the
    // command in backticks will be evaluated, and output will be redirected to "outfile". The user is
    // responsible for knowing the type of shell that this will be run in, and doing any escaping necessary.
    "args": "`echo hello` > outfile",

    // If you pass args as an array, the characters will be escaped for the terminal so that the program
    // receives them verbatim.
    "args": ["`echo hello` > outfile"]
}
```

### Picker for debug sessions

When debugging, you can now run **Debug: Select Debug Session** in the Command Palette. This shows a picker with your active debug sessions, which you can use to search and filter your individual debug sessions. The description for each picker item will show the session that spawned it, if applicable. Selecting an item in the picker will open the Debug Console from within the context of the selected debug session.

![Debug Session Picker Demo](images/1_70/debug-sessions.gif)

## Languages

### Keep newlines when formatting JSON

You can now keep the initial line position when formatting a line in a JSON documents. For example, an array containing values on one line will still contain these values on the same line after formatting. To enable this feature, set the option **JSON > Format: Keep Lines** in the Setting editor.

## Notebooks

### Go to Most Recently Failed Cell

If your most recently run cell failed, there is now a button that will jump to that cell. You can also run **Notebook: Go to Most Recently Failed Cell** to perform the same action.

This is useful when you run a group of cells and want to know which cell failed and halted the group execution.

![Go To Most Recently Failed Cell Demo](images/1_70/go-to-most-recently-failed-cell.gif)

## VS Code for the Web

### Set Display Language

You can now set the display language of the browser using **Set Display Language** button available on the language pack extension.

![Set Display Language](images/1_70/set-display-language.png)

Once set, you can clear the display language by using the **Clear Display Language** button on the currently set language pack extension.

![Clear Display Language](images/1_70/clear-display-language.png)

## Contributions to extensions

### Python

#### Experimental extension: WWBD

There is a new experimental Python extension named [WWBD](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brettcannon.wwbd) that acts as a sandbox for environment workflow ideas. As of now, there is a **Create Environment** command for virtual environments to see if a single command can help users set up a new virtual environment (see the WWBD extension page for the full details and other extension features). You can read the [Ideas category](https://github.com/brettcannon/WWBD/discussions/categories/ideas) in the project repository for other ideas that are being considered, including conda support.

#### New Getting started experience

We've polished the Python walkthrough flow so users can smoothly transition to installing Python if they need to. A Windows Store or appropriate walkthrough tile is opened when Python is not installed and users can now auto-run the displayed instructions. Any prompts related to interpreters are only shown when a user action requires one, and not on start-up. Also, UI prompts have been improved to be more precise about errors and suggested changes.

#### Interpreter information in the Status bar

A new setting `python.interpreter.infoVisibility` was added, which controls when information about the selected interpreter is displayed in the Status bar. It can be set to `always` to revert to the old behavior where the selected interpreter is displayed regardless of what file is opened. By default, interpreter information will only be shown when Python-related files are opened (`onPythonRelated`). A warning status is added to indicate situations when the selected interpreter is invalid:

![Interpreter information in the Status bar](images/1_70/interpreter-info.png)

## Preview features

### Sticky scroll

It is now possible to display UI showing in which scope the user is in during scrolling. The sticky scroll UI will show in which class/interface/namespace/function/method/constructor the top of the editor is in, allowing for easier localization within a document.

!["Sticky scroll" Demo](images/1_70/sticky-scroll.gif)

### TypeScript 4.8 support

This update includes support for the upcoming TypeScript 4.8 release. See the [TypeScript 4.8 iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/49074) for more details on what the TypeScript team is currently working on.

To start using the TypeScript 4.8 nightly builds, install the [TypeScript Nightly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next) extension.

### Settings Profiles

We have been working the last couple of months to support **Settings Profiles** in VS Code, which is one of the most popular asks from the community. This feature is available for preview in the [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) release via `workbench.experimental.settingsProfiles.enabled` setting. Try it out and let us know your feedback by creating issues in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues) or commenting in [issue #116740](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/116740).

In this milestone, we also added support for **Settings Profiles** in VS Code for the Web. You can try it out using [insiders.vscode.dev](https://insiders.vscode.dev) and the same `workbench.experimental.settingsProfiles.enabled` setting.

![Settings Profiles demo, showing the theme, zoom level, and Activity bar position changing as the profile is switched](images/1_70/settings-profiles.gif)

_Theme: [Light Pink](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgwg.light-pink-theme)_

### Task reconnection

On window reload, watch tasks can be reconnected to by enabling `task.experimental.reconnection`, which results in a faster return to work following an extension change or VS Code version update.

## Extension Authoring

### 'not in' operator for 'when' clauses

There is an operator that already exists for when clauses, `in`, which allows for dynamic lookup of a context key's value within another context key with an array or object-type value. We've added a new operator `not in`, which negates this. See the [when clause contexts](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/when-clause-contexts#in-and-not-in-conditional-operators) documentation for details.

### htmlLanguageParticipants contribution point

A new contribution point `htmlLanguageParticipants` allows HTML-like languages to declare that they want to inherit all HTML language server features such as code completions, hovers, and outline. This is useful for programming language extensions that don't want to implement a full language server.

An example is the built-in `handlebars` extension that now adds itself to the `htmlLanguageParticipants` in its `package.json`:

```json
"contributes": {
  "htmlLanguageParticipants": [
     {
       "languageId": "handlebars"
      }
    ]
}
```

The [Quarkus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-quarkus) extension has already adopted the contribution point. It enriches the HTML features with additional proposals for the embedded [Qute](https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference) HTML template language:

![Qute HTML participant](images/1_70/qute-html-participant.gif)

### Drop into editor API

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Proposed APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always, we want your feedback. Here are the steps to try out a proposed API:

1. [Find a proposal that you want to try](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/src/vscode-dts) and add its name to `package.json#enabledApiProposals`.
1. Use the latest [vscode-dts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-dts) and run `vscode-dts dev`. It will download the corresponding `d.ts` files into your workspace.
1. You can now program against the proposal.

You cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. There may be breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### Webview context menus

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### 'argsCanBeInterpretedByShell' for RunInTerminalRequest

The `RunInTerminalRequest` supports a new property, `argsCanBeInterpretedByShell`, which tells the client whether special shell characters in the command `args` should be left unescaped. This is to enable users to write launch configs that will start in a terminal, and include characters that should be interpreted by the shell.

## Engineering

### Progress for Electron sandbox support

This milestone we made substantial progress toward enabling Electron's [sandbox](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/sandbox) by default. We plan on enabling sandbox in August for Insiders and eventually make it the default in Stable VS Code.

For the curious out there, configuring `"window.experimental.useSandbox": true` in settings will enable sandbox mode. Hopefully you should not notice anything changing, but if you find issues, please report them back to us.

### Markdown language server

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Extensible HTML notebook renderer

<!-- TODO: mjbvz -->

### Debian package dependencies

Debian package dependencies are now generated by a script rather than hard-coded. This closes an [issue filed back in 2016](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/13089) where missing dependencies would cause the program to crash at runtime on some machines.

## Documentation and extensions

### Development container CLI

The [dev container command-line interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainer-cli) (CLI) topic was updated for the [newest version](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/05/18/dev-container-cli) of the CLI. The dev container CLI lets you build and run dev containers and is an open-source reference implementation of the [Development Container Specification](https://containers.dev)

### Azure Developer CLI (azd)

The [Azure Developer CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli) and its complementary [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.azure-dev) are now in public preview. The Azure Developer CLI (azd) accelerates the time it takes you to get from your local development environment to Azure by providing developer-friendly commands that map to key stages in your workflow: code, build, deploy, monitor, repeat.

![Azure Developer CLI extension](images/1_70/azure-dev-cli-extension.png)

The Azure Developer CLI uses [extensible templates](https://github.com/topics/azd-templates) that include everything you need to get an application up and running in Azure. The templates include best practices, application code and reusable infrastructure as code assets.  More than that, they cover end-to-end scenarios that go far past "Hello World!".

With the Azure Developer CLI, you can initialize, provision, and deploy an application, or better yet, use `'azd up'` to do so in one step! For a list of supported `azd` commands, see the [Developer CLI reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/reference).
